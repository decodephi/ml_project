# END TO END MACHINE LEANIING PROJECT

Day 1->
The basic project setup, including GitHub integration, environment management, and package configuration, is now complete. In the next session, the focus will be on developing the formal project structure and implementing logging and exception handling.
# Key Points:
1. The setup.py file is essential for packaging the project, and requirements.txt lists all necessary dependencies.
2. Using .gitignore prevents unnecessary files, such as environment folders, from being committed to the repository.
